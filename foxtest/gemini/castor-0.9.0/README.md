```
[general]
start_url = "gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/capcom"
max_width = 200

[colors]
h1 = "red"
h2 = "#FF6347"
h3 = "green"
list = "#C71585"
text = "#FF1493"
background = "#FFC0CB"
[colors.quote]
    foreground="#e4e4e4"
    background="grey"

[characters]
h1 = ">"
h2 = "))"
h3 = "}}}"
list = "ðŸŒ¼ "

[fonts]
[fonts.finger]
    family = "monospace"
    size = 11
[fonts.gemini.text]
    family = "serif"
    size = 11
[fonts.gemini.h1]
    family = "sans"
    size = 16
    style = "normal"
[fonts.gemini.h2]
    family = "monospace"
    size = 13
    style = "italic"
[fonts.gemini.h3]
    family = "monospace"
    size = 12
[fonts.gemini.list]
    family = "sans"
    size = 11
    style = "oblique"
[fonts.gemini.quote]
    family = "sans"
    size = 10
    style = "italic"
[fonts.gopher]
    family = "monospace"
    size = 11
```


## Using client certificate

Castor expects your certificates to be placed in your home directory and named after the gemini capsule domain.
For example to water your plant on `gemini://astrobotany.mozz.us/plant` you will need to have `astrobotany.mozz.us.crt`
and `astrobotany.mozz.us.key` available in your home.
